## As of Sep. 15 2019 this project is compatible with the latest version of django

## Important Notes:
#### No settings.py included. For security reasons I can not include a settings.py
#### Dependencies are psycopg2, pillow, django-storages, boto3, django-bootstrap4, django-crispy-forms; Install them with pip
#### `pip3 install django pillow django-storages boto3 psycopg2-binary django-bootstrap4 django-crispy-forms`

## Setup:
#### After installing dependencies
#### `python3 manage.py makemigrations` (You may have to specify each individual app as an argument)
#### `python3 manage.py migrate`
#### `python3 manage.py runserver`
#### > Voila, its all setup. Change this however you like to suit your own purposes. If you need help you can email me
#### `jbsalenger@mcdonogh.org`

## Stable releases *only* show up on this repository everything else is developed in private to avoid confusion and so I can write less documentation
